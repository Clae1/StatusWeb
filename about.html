                <h2>What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</h2>

                            A special feature in creating the website was the detailed buttons. I used a website called "https://css-tricks.com/examples/ButtonMaker/#"
                            to help me create buttons that are more appealing and responsive. When a user hovers over the button it reacts and changes color making it 
                            easy for users to know if a button is clickable or not. 
                        </p>

            <!-- This section of the container explains the parts of the website I had trouble with  -->
            <div class="question">
                <h2>Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</h2>
                <ul class="about_list">
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph"> 
                            Had trouble with creating error messages for the "poststatusprocess.php", creating a regular expression
                            for the Status code was a bit hard at first as despite what metacharacters and sequences are used the 
                            specific inputs were still allowed. After some research, I needed to add "^" and "$" in the syntax to ensure
                            that reg_match() function reads the syntax or pattern from beginning to end.   
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph"> 
                            The style or CSS of the website was a bit difficult to manage at times. I wanted the design of the website 
                            to be simple and clean so that the user knows what information they are looking at and what they are able to
                            click. I had trouble figuring out what html tags needed a specific class and what CSS code is needed to achieve 
                            the design that I was looking for as the CSS file of the website did not update immediately. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph"> 
                            Another thing I had trouble with was when the database was reset. If one were 
                            to create a status post and submit it, the same error message would occur regardless of what other errors were 
                            present in the field. The issue was that my PHP code will both create and submit the information to the table Which
                            is not possilbe as the table does not exist when submitting. I had to move query, that created the table, to 
                            "poststatusform.php" so that when a user enters the page it will check if the table exist or not. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- This section of the container explains the things I would to do better next time for the website -->
            <div class="question">
                <h2>What would you like to do better next time?</h2>
                <ul class="about_list">
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Next time I would to like the database to have tables with one to many relationship, currently the website only uses a 
                            Primary table and nothing more. Based on the assignment users can choose many permissions, in terms of 
                            relational tables, we can make a child table for the permissions using the Status code primary key as the foriegn key 
                            creating a one to many relationship. If we to update the status form, we can search a post based on the permissions. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Next time I would like to use more Bootstrap features. Currently, the website is mostly designed with Basic CSS code, 
                            and due to this the containers and layout of the website is not too responsive to window size changes. Using Bootstrap I could 
                            also design a more appealing design for the website by using the grid systems. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Another improvement I would like to make for the next website is create a better designed layout. The current design
                            of the website is simple, which is good, but not too appealing. I can add a navigation bar, side bars or more
                            functionalities to make the website less generic. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Next time I hope to learn how to implement images using the web server. I tried attempting to implement images to the website, but despite
                            what paths were put into the url or src, the web browswer was unable to locate the image files. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Lastly, for next time I would like to improve how the error messages are displayed. Currently, the error messages only appear 
                            one at a time, thus each click of the submit may show a unique error messages which is not ideal for the user experience.
                            Possibiliy using bootstrap, when there is an error with a text field it will the field will turn red and a pop-up window 
                            will appear to indicate to user what needs to be updated or changed. 
                        </p>

                <h2>What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this

                            One of the things I have learnt is how to extract information from the form, and use PHP code to do a varierty of task:
                            <ul class="about_list">
                                <li>Create error messages based on user input</li>

                    <li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Another thing I have learnt is how to use Regular expressions to help handle error messages using differnt types of fields,
                            and search for specific information on a database. It has made it easier to handle errors within a textfield as I do not have
                            to create complex IF statement conditions. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I have learnt how to style the webpage more through more complex CSS code. I used websites such as css3clickchart and 
                            css tricks to help me implement the styles for ceratin features of the website. For example, the buttons are more 
                            stylized and more appealing.

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Lastly, I have learnt how to connect MyPHP to the Web server, and use query statments to create new data into the tables,
                            delete tables, create data and search data within a table. This will help apply this knowledge towards future web 
                            development projects.
